                Hi! I'm Jianyao, a physics major with a particular interest in quantum information and quantum computing. I hold a Bachelor and Master's degree in applied physics
                from TU Delft, and I've done a lot of work on topics such as scientific programming, quantum communications / quantum internet, and machine learning.<br>
                In my free time, I enjoy the process of problem solving while learning new skills, and getting better in tangible ways by overcoming challenges encountered in the process. 
                As an example of which, I picked up HTML5 and CSS in order to code this website! <br>
                The purpose of this website is to give you a better idea of who I am as a person. This is still an early version, but I still hope that what's on here will be interesting for you to have a look at!
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    If you're here on business, thanks for stopping by! I've attached a copy of my CV for your reading convenience: You can find it under the CV tab, 
                    or by clicking <a href="cv.html">here</a>.
                </p>
